            <p>York loves to stay active and go on long walks by his house. He also enjoys chewing on his large assortment of toys. His favorite toy is his squeaky pig. York’s favorite food is sausage, but cheese is another favorite.</p>
            <p>York is a very sociable dog and is a licensed therapy dog. He frequently visits nursing homes and other places in an attempt to raise peoples’ spirits.

                <img src = "images/labradoodle_leo.JPG" alt = "Tan labradoodle " style="width:400px; " class = "toobig">
                 
                 <p>Leo is a very hyper labradoodle who enjoys running around and meeting new people. Leo recently turned six back in July, and received two toys for his birthday which he has already destroyed. Leo also enjoys laying around the house, his favorite spots being my parents bedroom and the living room couch. 
                <p> Leo is a big fan of when the mailman comes because that means he will get a treat. At bedtime, Leo waits for both of my parents to get into bed before he goes to bed. He thinks he needs to guard them while they are both still awake.</p>

            <div><h2>Lincoln</h2>
            <img src="images/lincoln_w.JPG" alt="Yellow lab" style="width: 400px;">
            <p>
                Lincoln is a very intelligent dog. There are times when I don't go pet him and you can see it in his eyes, he is holding a grudge. For the next hour or so he won't come when I call him but will look at me with eyes that say, You did this. Another example of his intelligence is he is an ace at hide and seek, as well as other games a dog should not be able to play.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lincoln is not a huge fan of his brother (my other dog), Rainier. When Rainier gets any form of attention, Lincoln will put himself into the scene and bark as if he is being mistreated. He is not being mistreated, Lincoln is just a wimp.

            <img src="images/cheeto_cattree.jpg" width="400" alt="Orange cat hanging paws off a cat tower">
        
        

            <p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get
            outside every single day. If he isn't causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and
            sleeping.
            </p>
            <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie
            chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six
            years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.

            <p>Jingle loves going outside. He used to be an outdoor/indoor cat until we realized that he loved to get injured. Now, we take him on walks with a leash which he loves! Every time he sees me carrying the leash he goes crazy and meows to go out.</p>
            <p>Jingle is very mischievous, he has gotten into many different accidents. His first accident was outside; a bee stung his paw and he cried all night long. The second one was ALSO outside, he got stuck on a tree for four days. Finally, he came back home one day with his tail bleeding and ripped out.</p>

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>
